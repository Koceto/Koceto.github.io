You can do almost as much as you can in _html_. Although you cannot use ~~JavaScript~~, it's still fun.

1. It is very easy to use/write.
1. Very easy to get used to.
1. And even easier to do a page.
1. Also you can insert<span style="background-color: lightblue;border-color: green;border-style: solid;border-radius: 10px;padding: 4px;">html/css</span> in it.
1. And code hightlights.
1. What more can you do?!
1. Well, after couple of hours it turns out, MarkDown does not suport JavaScript, still it's very cool.

**_Oh?_ Did i mention you can do un-ordered lists?**

- You can, I promise.
- This is an example.

**Here's a language syntax hightlight.**

_It's soo easy to use/add._

```csharp
string s = "C# syntax highlighting";
Console.WriteLine(s);
```

Let's not even start with links.

Hello from [Google!](http://www.google.com)

And I have a [Title](http://www.google.com "It's my Title")

It can tell if it's a link <http://www.google.com>

That's me' logo!
