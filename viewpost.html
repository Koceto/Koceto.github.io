                        <h2>Rothschild Family</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>The Rothschild family is a wealthy family descending from Mayer Amschel Rothschild,
                        a court Jew to the German Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel in the Free City of Frankfurt,
                        who established his banking business in the 1760s. Unlike most previous court Jews,
                        Rothschild managed to bequeath his wealth and established an international banking family through his five sons,
                        who established themselves in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Vienna, and Naples.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the 19th century, the Rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world,
                        as well as the largest private fortune in modern world history.
                        The family's wealth was divided among various descendants and today their interests cover a diverse range of fields,
                        including financial services, real estate, mining, energy, mixed farming, winemaking and nonprofits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories,
                        many of which are antisemitic in nature.
